## More creeps and weirdoes ##

### Minetest mod that brings More creeps and weirdoes back to life. #####

a bit of creep history:

Creeps were mostly made by [freakstritch](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272354-1-2-5-morecreeps-weirdos-v2-62-slot-machines-old) in 2012 and not updated over minecraft 1.2.5 for quite a while. Since then a reboot was started by [Astromojang](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2506162-more-creeps-and-weirdos-rebooted-for-minecraft-1-8) he made it open source but quit working on it year later. Now the mod has gotten picked up by [RickWeek84](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2742898-1-10-2-morecreeps-weirdos-reborn-v1-2-beta-creepy) and seems to be updated to the latest version.

But these weirdo creeps should be everywhere thats why they are coming to Minetest.

This mod is still far from complete. Feel free to contribute code, improve the models, suggest new creeps and features.

Things to do:
-creep animation
-creep abilities
-item functions
